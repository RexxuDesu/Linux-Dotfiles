# Using Polybar for the first time
If you're an experienced Polybar user then no need to follow this. If you however, are someone who is fairly new or has no experience with Polybar, you must follow this.

# Installation:
Clone this repository with this command. (This will copy the repository to your **/home** directory).
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/RexxuDesu/Linux-Dotfiles Linux-Dotfiles
```

Then navigate to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd ~/Linux-Dotfiles
```
Then copy & paste the folder:
```bash
cp -r polybar ~/.config/polybar
```
OR move it:
```bash
mv -r polybar ~/.config/polybar
```

OR you may follow this if you don't want the nerd crap:

Download the files or **git clone** it. Find the folder then navigate to the **polybar** folder, copy the folder then paste it on **~/.config**.
