# Using Polybar for the first time
If you're an experienced Polybar user then no need to follow this. If you however, are someone who is fairly new or has no experience with Polybar, you must follow this.

# The nerd way
Clone this repository with this command. (This will copy the repository to your **/home** directory.
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/RexxuDesu/Linux-Dotfiles Linux-Dotfiles
```

Then navigate to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd ~/Linux-Dotfiles
```

Then copy & paste the folder OR move it:
```bash
cp -r polybar ~/.config/polybar
```

# The lazy way
Download the files or **git clone** it. Find the folder then navigate to the **polybar** folder, copy the folder then paste it on **~/.config**.
